This is a voice based prescription model in which prescription is formatted by the dictation of the doctor and sends to the patient phone via email address
I have written the code using python
To run the code we need the following packages:
1)tkinter
2)smtplib
3)speech_recognition 
install them using pip command
We also need pyaudio file for executing and running the code
you can download from the following link:
https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/
download the file according to the version of your python and paste the file in the pip folder of python and the copy the name of the file and in cmd 
enter pip install and paste the file name
then pyaudio is installed successfully
